Purity
======
*A simple lightweight android launcher*

####Why ?
All this starts from observation focused on the wallpaper. For me a wallpaper is important to look at, and admire, since it is primarily personal and reflette usually an aspect of something that we highly appreciate. And most launcher I've seen, it was not highlighted :see_no_evil:. So I decide for myself from overrule the refusal to make my wallpaper in the center :crown: and no longer hide.

####Where ?
After a few prototypes of this application, one of those that it proved to be the most likely to continue the project. So I took the decision to openly reveal this application :confetti_ball: :balloon: :tada: :balloon: :confetti_ball: I dear to myself :revolving_hearts: hanging some time before you to share it, hoping you like it.

You can find the latest versions in the "releases" tab, or the laziest [follow the guide](https://github.com/axelmarchand/Purity/releases).
